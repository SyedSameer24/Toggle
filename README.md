This project is a dark/light mode toggle switch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed as part of my journey as a beginner in web development. The primary goal of this project was to understand and implement the concept of toggling themes using JavaScript. The toggle functionality is achieved by dynamically adding and removing CSS classes that define the styles for dark and light modes. When the button is clicked, an event listener in JavaScript checks the current mode and switches it accordingly, while also updating the console to reflect the current theme state. The HTML structure is simple, consisting of a paragraph and a button element. The CSS is kept basic, focusing on essential styling for dark and light modes, where the dark theme sets a black background with white text, and the light theme does the opposite. Although the button currently has a simple design, the primary focus was on mastering the toggling functionality rather than advanced styling. This project not only strengthened my understanding of how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript but also gave me a practical introduction to event handling and class manipulation. Additionally, I learned how to structure basic HTML and apply minimal CSS to achieve a functional outcome. Going forward, I aim to enhance this project by improving the button design, adding smooth animations, and ensuring the toggle switch offers a modern and intuitive user experience. I also plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as transitions and transformations, to make the toggle switch feel more interactive and visually appealing. This project marks a small but significant step in my web development journey, and it reflects my progress in learning how to build interactive elements using core web technologies.
